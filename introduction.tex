Tribler is a peer-to-peer file sharing program developed by the Delft University of Technology for research purposes.
Tribler expands the BitTorrent protocol and has added multiple improvements on this protocol.
The main focus of Tribler is to make security and privacy the default for Internet users and impossible to shutdown.
A fully distributed program, not relying on any central component, is needed to achieve this.
Tribler has been designed and build using this methodology\cite{Pouwelse-tribler}\cite{Bakker-tribler}.
This master thesis was conducted as part of the research mission to improve Tribler.
