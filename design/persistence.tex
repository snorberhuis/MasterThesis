\section{Block persistence}
The blocks in the chain have to be persisted to be usable over a prolonged time.
A persistence layer is added to the MultiChain community
that provides all functionality to persist blocks and query blocks.
This layer extends and uses functionality of the Database class in Dispersy.
An overview of the layering in the software architecture can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:persistence-layer}.

The MultiChain Community calls functions in the persistence layer that have implicit knowledge about the model.
The Persistence layer formats SQL queries and passes these to the Dispersy layer.
The Dispersy layer performs several sanitation checks and passes these queries to the SQLite Library.
The SQLite Library and Dispersy layer both return the result of the SQL query.
These results are transformed by the Persistence layer into objects of the model usable by the MultiChain Community.

The only information that is saved are blocks.
The information all fits within one table.
A single block is saved as a single record called a row in a relation database.
Every attribute of a block is a single column in the row.
All attributes are saved directly into the database,
except for the public keys.
These public keys are hashed and these hashes are used as an identifier, called mid, in Dispersy.
The public keys are already saved in the Dispersy database.
When a block is retrieved from the database the public key is retrieved from Dispersy using the mid.

Every attribute is queryable in the database.
A public key can be converted to mid and is searched this way.
Every attribute is queryable to make the system  extensible
and usable when the next incremental steps are implemented.
It is presently unknown what information precisly will be needed,
so every information is now made available for the future.

\subsection{Dispersy database}
Dispersy keeps track of information on its own.
A record is kept of any message that can be retrieved using a message id.
The message is saved in a converted format and will be decoded when the message is retrieved.

Instead of storing information in a separate database,
the information could have been retrieved from the Dispersy database.
But the Dispersy database is not queryable.
All the information is stored in a converted format
that prevents queries to search the message for its contents.
For this reason, the dispersy database is not used and a separate database is used.

A future, possible improvement to Dispersy would be to save messages queryable in its database.
This would eliminate the current need for separate databases that contain aggregrated information.
The information is stored in two places within Tribler and this could be eliminated.
It would reduce the disk footprint and the amount of read/write transactions
as only one database would have to be maintained.
The I/O ineractions are a problem according to Tribler maintainers.
