\section{Community within Tribler}
Tribler uses communities to add functionalities to peers.
A peer loads in a community and this community provides a set of messages and endpoints for other peers.
The community can communicate with the endpoints of other peers as well and send a message to these endpoint.
Other peers are automatically discovered using Dispersy.
Examples of a community are the TunnelCommunity that adds functionality to download anonymously\cite{Plak-anonymous}
or the AllChannelCommunity to distribute torrent files.
The designed system will be implemented by adding a new community to Tribler.
