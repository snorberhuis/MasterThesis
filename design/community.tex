\section{MultiChain Community}
Tribler uses communities to add functionalities to peers.
A peer loads in a community and this community provides a set of messages and endpoints for other peers.
The community can communicate with the endpoints of other peers as well and send a message to these endpoint.
Other peers are automatically discovered using Dispersy.
Examples of a community are the TunnelCommunity that adds functionality to download anonymously\cite{Plak-anonymous}
or the AllChannelCommunity to distribute torrent files.
The designed system will be implemented by adding a new community to Tribler.

The MultiChain community can be run standalone,
but its main use is to integrate with Tribler and track up and download for torrents.
It will replace the current reputation system Bartercast in the future.
