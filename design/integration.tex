\section{Integration with Tribler}
For integration a scheduler is implemented between the MultiChain community
and other parts of Tribler.
The scheduler tracks session upload and download amounts and schedules a block to be created,
when the amount of uploaded bytes is above a certain threshold.
The scheduler currently only tracks traffic of anonymous downloads.
Bartercast is not yet removed and
currently MultiChain runs together with Bartercast until MultiChain fully replaces Bartercast.

We recommend that the scheduler should be expanded to schedule blocks in a more sophisticated way.
The functionality of the scheduler is very limited and is missing basic functionality.
The most important improvement that should be introduced is the punishment of not signing blocks.
Currently, nodes can deny to have their behaviour tracked.
The next improvement is to actually determine the level of cooperation a node receives based upon their previous behaviour.
The actual decision making based upon past behaviour is not part of the thesis.
The processes of actually making the descision is a complicated process that has to take into account a lot of variables
and requires extensive experimentation to validate.
