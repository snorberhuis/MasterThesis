\section{Integration with Tribler}
The MultiChain community can be run standalone,
but its main use is to integrate with Tribler and track up and download for torrents.
It will replace the current reputation system Bartercast in the future.

For integration a scheduler is implemented between the MultiChain community
and the community that handles the anonymous download.
For additional detail on the anonymous download communities see \cite{Plak-anonymous}\cite{ruigrok-anonymous}.
The scheduler tracks session up and download amounts and schedules a block to be created,
when the amount of uploaded bytes is above a certain threshold.
The scheduler currently only tracks traffic of anonymous downloads.
Bartercast is not yet removed and
currently MultiChain runs together with Bartercast untill MultiChain fully replaces Bartercast.

The scheduler should be expanded in the future to schedule blocks in a more sophisticated way.
The functionality of the scheduler is very limited and is missing basic functionality.
The most important improvement that should be introduced is the punishment of not signing blocks.
Currently, nodes can deny to have their behaviour tracked.
The next improvement is to actually determine the level of cooperation a node receives based upon their previous behaviour.
The actual decision making based upon past behaviour is not part of the thesis.
