\section{Irrevocable Proof-of-Help}
Digital signatures have the property to be non-repudiable of origin.\cite{VanderLubbe-crypto}.
After signing a message the signer cannot later deny providing his signature.
Only in the possesion of a secret key can a signature be made,
so only the signer could have made the signature.
This is assuming the secret key was not comprimised at the time of signing.

This property results in that after creating a block
both participants can no longer deny involvement in that block.
Because they cannot repudiate their own signature
and the act of creating signature needs a conscious decision denoting approval of the claim of help.
The blocks become irrevocable proofs-of-help.

\section{Publicly known free-riding}
The system will make a node's share ratio publicly accessibly,
but it will expose and limit freeriding in several other ways.

The window of potential freeriding is chosen by the willingness of seeders to be altruistic.
Because the creation of blocks is driven by seeders,
downloaders cannot postpone creation of blocks and continue freeriding.
If downloaders does not participate in block creation,
then uploading to them will stop.

Downloaders cannot repudiate downloading.
For they granted their signature to a block containing information about the amount that they downloaded.
A freerider cannot try to hide his freeriding afterwards.
