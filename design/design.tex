\chapter{Design and implementation}
This chapter presents the design of MultiChain and how it was implemented.
The first thing that will be introduced is how MultiChain is implemented within Tribler
to outline the context of the design and implementation.
The contents of blocks are presented and how they form chains in MultiChain.
We will cover the creation of blocks and the multiple implications of the chosen design.
We will explain how MultiChain adresses the freeriding problem.
Additional pheripheral systems that work with MultiChain are also explained.

\section{Datastructure design}
In this section we wil describe how the chains inside MultiChain are designed.
We will first describe the contents of a single block.
Next, we will explain how blocks are chained together for a single peer.
These chains are intertwined and we will clarify this entanglement.
Finally, we will describe how the blocks provide security against tampering.

\section{Block creation protocol}
\label{design:block_creation}
In this section we will explain how blocks can be created with a simple design
that will limit and expose freeriding.
Afterwards we will explain a fundamental problem with creating blocks in an asynchronous system.
This problem is present in the simple design
and we will describe how MultiChain deals with this problem.
