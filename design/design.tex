\chapter{Design and implementation}
This chapter contains the design of MultiChain and how it was implemented.
We will describe how MultiChain is part of Tribler and its main pillar of design.
The contents of blocks are presented and how they form chains in MultiChain.
We will cover the creation of blocks and the multiple implications of the chosen design.
Additional pheripheral systems that work with MultiChain are also explained.
