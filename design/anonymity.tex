\section{Anonymity}
Tribler has made an effort in providing a way for users to download anonymously\cite{Plak-anonymous}\cite{ruigrok-anonymous}.
There is anonymity in the contents of what is downloaded, not in how much is downloaded.
MultiChain obviously cannot break this anonymity to be usuable for anonymous downloads.
The introduction of anonymity increases the necessity of a good reputation system as more data has to be transferred.

MultiChain only interacts with peers that are directly downloaded from or uploaded to.
With these peers blocks are created and transferred.
So anonymity is not broken by MultiChain.
An attacker could already analyse network traffic between these peers
and conclude they are downloading and uploading to each other.
But Tribler does not guarantee anonymity for this.
So MultiChain does not break anonymity with its interactions with peers.

A block only transcribe the amount of data that has been transferred between peers.
The content of the actual data is not transcribed.
The block also does not leak information of how big a single, individual transfer is between peers.
The amounts are aggregrated over all transfers.
The blocks also does not break the anonymity.
Network analysis can already measure the total amount of data transferred.
So the design and implementation of MultiChain does not break anonymity already guaranteed by Tribler.

But MultiChain does make network analysis easier as measurement points between every node do not have to be introduced.
The chain of every node can be requested.k
The chain contains the data of every transaction of a peer and can be used to analyse the network.
