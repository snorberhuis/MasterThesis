\chapter{Experimentation}

In this chapter multiple graphs are depicted.
These graphs are generated by reading every database of every node.
The blocks are depicted as nodes and the previous hash pointers are edges in the graph.
The nodes have added colouring to indicate extra meaning.
Green nodes are a first block in a MultiChain of a peer,
and as such have no inbound arrows.
Blue nodes are a sequential block between the same previous peers,
therefore they do not have two inbound arrows.
Red nodes are half-signed blocks,
and therefore only have one inbound and one outbound arrow.

Some experiments were also run multiple times because Dispersy does not always connect to every peer.
At the start of the experiment the peers are forced to be introduced,
but this does not always succeed.
This is a problem in discoverability and has been experienced by previous work aswell\cite{ruigrok-anonymous}.
This also happens when downloading a torrent in the real world.
The final version is chosen when Dispersy did connect all the peers.
