\chapter{Implementation and experiments}
The design of MultiChain in the previous chapter has been fully implemented.
In this chapter we test if MultiChain is correctly implemented according to the design
and we experiment the MultiChain in various scenarios.
MultiChain is experimented with to test if it can correctly create a chain tracking a download.
Next, MultiChain is experimented with tracking anonymous downloads.
Finally, MultiChain is experimented with in potential situations where a deadlock may occur
to test if it succesfully resolve these situations.

In this chapter multiple graphs are depicted.
These graphs are generated by reading every database of every node.
The blocks are depicted as nodes and the previous hash pointers are edges in the graph.
The nodes have added colouring to indicate extra meaning.
This can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:graph-example}
Green nodes are a first block in a MultiChain of a peer,
and as such have no inbound arrows.
Blue nodes are a sequential block between the same previous peers,
therefore they do not have two inbound arrows.
Red nodes are half-signed blocks,
and therefore only have one inbound and one outbound arrow.

Some experiments were also run multiple times because Dispersy does not always connect to every peer.
At the start of the experiment the peers are forced to be introduced,
but this does not always succeed.
This is a problem in discoverability and has been experienced by previous work aswell~\cite{ruigrok-anonymous}.
The final version is chosen when Dispersy did connect all the peers.
We recommend that Dispersy is changed to allow a modified behaviour when experimenting
where the pool of candidates is not refreshed,
as explained in section \ref{sect:bartercast}

\section{Tracking download and upload amounts}
In this section we will experiment with MultiChain creating blocks and tracking download and upload amounts of peers.
We will first start with creating a simple block in an experiment.
The next experiment is to try to create a chain of blocks with mimicking a download of 10MB
and a larger download of 10GB.
Downloads are done at different download speeds and an experiment was done to test MultiChain in this environment.

\section{Tracking anonymous data transfer}
In this section we will experiment with MultiChain tracking anonymous data transfer.
Anonymous data transfer is a more complicated environment,
where multiple peers work together to transfer data from the seeder to the leecher.
We experiment in a synthetic environment and in environment using real anonymous downloads between peers.
