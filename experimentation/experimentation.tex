\chapter{Experimentation}

In this chapter multiple graphs are depicted.
These graphs are generated by reading every database of every node.
The blocks are depicted as nodes and the previous hash pointers are edges in the graph.
The nodes have added colouring to indicate extra meaning.
Green nodes are a first block in a MultiChain of a peer,
and as such have no inbound arrows.
Blue nodes are a sequential block between the same previous peers,
therefore they do not have two inbound arrows.
Red nodes are half-signed blocks,
and therefore only have one inbound and one outbound arrow.
