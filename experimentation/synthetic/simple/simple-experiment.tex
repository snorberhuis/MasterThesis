\subsection{Simple download }
In this experiment we measure if MultiChain can correctly track the upload and download amounts between two peers.
A gumby scenario was created that mimicks running a download within Tribler.
In the scenario a file of 100 MB is downloaded at different speeds,
respectively 500 KB/s, 750 KB/s, 1000 KB/s, 1250 KB/s, 2000 KB/s, and 3000 KB/s.
The scheduler waits for 1000MB before scheduling a block.
The upload and download of the file is done by three different pairs of seeders and leechers.
Every second these amounts are reported to have been download to the scheduler of MultiChain.

\end{figure}

The total download and upload amounts of every peer is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:synthetic-simple-amounts}.
Every datapoint is the total download amount in a block.
These datapoints are connected by a dotted line representing the link between these datapoints.
The plots show that MultiChain is able to correctly track the download and upload amounts without a problem.
There are no hitches in the figures and the amounts go up in fixed increments corresponding to the different speeds.
This means that MultiChain is fast enough to correctly track the amounts.

The download speeds below the threshold of 1000 MB of the scheduler
are not distinguishable from the download at the threshold speed.
This is because the scheduler waits until the threshold is reached before initiating the block.
The amount is tracked in the same amount of blocks,
but the total time of the experiment is longer for these experiments.
If the speed goes above the threshold, then this is reflected in the figure.

The graph in Figure \ref{fig:synthetic-simple-graph} shows the graph of the blocks created by the experiment.
The graph is disconnected, because the different pairs of seeders and leechers did not interact with each other.
So no block that would connect their chains is created,
This leaves the graph disconnected.

This experiment was run several times before the final version in this report was run.
Earlier versions of the experiment resulted in two bugfix and two improvements:
the ability of the scheduler to create a block at the end of a download.
The experiment was also run multiple times because Dispersy does not always connect to every peer.
At the start of the experiment the peers are forced to be introduced,
but this does not always succeed.
This is a problem in discoverability and has been experienced by previous work aswell\cite{ruigrok-anonymous}.
This also happens when downloading a torrent in the real world.
The final version is chosen when Dispersy did connect all the peers.
