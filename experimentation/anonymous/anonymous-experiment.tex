\subsection{Synthetic anonymous download}
In an anonymous download scenario the data is downloaded through multiple hops.
A seeder uploads data to the first hop.
This hop relays the data to the second hop.
The second hop sends the data to its destination at the leecher.
This can be seen as sequence of peers and is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:seeder-hops-leecher}.
More hops can be added to better safegaurd the anonymity of the download.

\end{figure}

The total download and upload amount is plotted, in the same way as the previous experiment,
in Figure \ref{fig:synthetic-anonymous-amounts}.
The slopes of the figures are not representative for the upload and download speeds of the peers.
This is because the x-axis represents the sequence-number of the block and not time.
The hops create blocks that can be categorized in two types:
a download validating block and an upload validating block.
The download validating block only contains information about how much the hop has downloaded
and is initiated by the peer in front of the peer in the sequence.
An upload validating block is initiated by the peer itself with the peer next in the sequence.
The seeder only has upload validating blocks and as such has half the amount of blocks.
The downloader has viceversa only download validating blocks.
The slope of his figure is much steeper as a result.

In the plot a discontinuity can be found at 92\% of the download in the figures of the seeder and the first hop.
This is the result of the first hop sending a signature request to the second hop.
The second hop was not able to process this request,
because it was already working on creating another block.
The second hop drop this request.
The first hop will still wait on the second hop to process its request until it will timeout.
In turn, the seeder sent a request to the first hop that will timeout,
because the first hop is not able to process this request aswell.
During the timeouts of the seeder and the first hop,
the second hop continues to validates its own upload amounts.
No blocks are created that validate his download amount,
so the slope becomes steeper during that time and the download amount remains level.
The timeouted peers create no blocks.
When the timeouts expires, the system returns to function as normal.
In section \ref{sect:deadlock-exp} we further experiment with the timeouts in the system.

The seeder and leecher both only interact with one hop.
These hops furthermore only interact with each other.
This can be clearly seen in a part of the graph magnified in Figure \ref{fig:synthetic-anonymous-graph-magnified}.
The middle nodes represent the interaction between the hops.
The outer nodes are interactions between the seeder and the first hop and between the second hop and leecher.
The blocks are created alternating resulting in the graph pictured.

In the graph the timeout period can be seen clearly in Figure \ref{fig:synthetic-anonymous-timeout}.
The two half-signed block can be seen in red.
The block with a reference coming from the outer block is the half-signed block belonging to the seeder.
The strain of blue nodes are the blocks created between the second hop and the leecher.
The red inner block is referenced by the first block created between the first hop and second hop after the timeout.
