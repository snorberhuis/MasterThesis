\subsection{Other related work}
The topic of reputation system is currently a subject of research for other projects as well.
There are two more projects worth to briefly mention because of similairity to the Tribler project
and the struggle to build a reputation system.
These projects are not so thoroughly explained as the blockchain
as they were not used as a starting point in designing MultiChain.
The Tor project is working on a implementation of a reputation system
in an effort to incentivize collaboration\cite{androulaki-torincentive}\cite{chen-torincentive}\cite{dingledine-torincentive}\cite{ghosh-torincentive}\cite{jansen-torincentive}.
The InterPlanetary File System \(IPFS\) is a peer-to-peer distributed file system with similairities to the Tribler project.
IPFS uses an incentivized block exchange to improve collaboration\cite{benet-ipfs}.
