The huge increase in Bitcoin adoption, 
due to the increase in uncertainty in the security of traditional currency 
after the financial crisis in 2008, 
is only rivaled by the speculation of the enormous possibilities 
of the underlying technology of the blockchain.
The blockchain is the first technology, seen with real world adoption,
that allows to register transactions without a trusted third party.
But the blockchain has several limitations in scalabillity 
that will limit Bitcoins in fully replacing traditional currencies with a digital currency.
It also limits blockchain as a scalable basis for a large scale reputation system, 
similair to a digital currency, with vast amounts of transactions.
This motivated to research the properties and possibilities of a variant of the blockchain:
multichain.
