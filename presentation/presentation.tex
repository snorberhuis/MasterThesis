Welcome every one to my defence of my Master's Thesis.
The subject of my thesis is: MultiChain: A cybercurrency for cooperation.
For my thesis I contributed with a first step in a new cybercurrency.
This was done with the Tribler team at the TU Delft.
They develop a peer-to-peer filesharing program.
I will first tell you the outline of my presentation.

\note{
I will start with describing you the problem that the new cybercurrency: MultiChain is trying to solve.
After that I will tell you about the design of MultiChain.
With MultiChain experiments were done to validate and test the system.
I will show you the result of these.
As this is a first step, some known vulnerabilities do exist and I will explain these.
Finally, I will conclude my thesis and describe future work.

\section{Problem Description}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Cooperation}
    \begin{definition}
		\emph{Cooperation}* is
		 \begin{itemize}[<+(1)->]
		    \item The action or process of working together to the same end.
		    \item Assitance, especially by complying readily with requests.
		 \end{itemize}
         \uncover<4->{
		    The essence of a collaborative, distributed system is that every node performs tasks for other nodes.
		    }
     \end{definition}

\end{frame}
\note{
So lets start with the problem description.
As the subtitle mentioned, MultiChain is to improve cooperation in a peer-to-peer system.
Cooperation is defined as the action or process of working together to the same end.
It is giving assitance upon request.
And this is the essence of a collaborative, distributed system: every participant helps each other.
This system is open to join by any participant.
A peer-to-peer network is such a system.

\frametitle{Deciding to help}
    \begin{figure}
        \includegraphics<1>[scale=0.3]{images/problem/direct-reciprocity-1.eps}
        \includegraphics<2>[scale=0.3]{images/problem/direct-reciprocity-2.eps}
        \includegraphics<3>[scale=0.3]{images/problem/direct-reciprocity-3.eps}
        \includegraphics<4->[scale=0.3]{images/problem/direct-reciprocity-4.eps}
        \caption{\emph{Direct Reciprocity} between participants.}
    \end{figure}
    \uncover<5->{
        \begin{definition}
            The \emph{Free rider problem} is
            \begin{itemize}
                \item those who benefit from public goods, do not pay for them.
            \end{itemize}
            A private history prevents freeriding in a simple situation.
        \end{definition}
    }
\end{frame}
\note{
But participants do not always help.
Lets take two participants A and B as an example.
Participant A can decide to provide help to B.
And B can return this help.
But he can also choose to not provide this help.

B now benefits from the help of A without contributing.
The help of A can be seen as a public good.
I now have explained the problem of Free riding to you.
If A remembers that B does not contribute,
he can prevent the freeriding of B by not giving him help in the future.
So a private history can prevent freeriding in the future.

But most often interactions between participants in a peer-to-peer network are single, and help cannot be exchanged.
}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Help peers that help others}
    \begin{figure}
        \includegraphics<1>[scale=0.3]{images/problem/indirect-reciprocity-1.eps}
        \includegraphics<2>[scale=0.3]{images/problem/indirect-reciprocity-2.eps}
        \includegraphics<3->[scale=0.3]{images/problem/indirect-reciprocity-3.eps}

	\uncover<4->{
         \begin{definition}
             The \emph{Shadow the Future} prevents A, B, C from deciding not to help.
         \end{definition}
     }
\end{frame}
\note{
Again A can decide to help B,
but he will not want to do so if B never contributes himself.
A will only help peers that help others.
So he will only do that if B himself helps others.

In turn A will only receive help from C if he provided B with help.
This is based upon his reputation for helping B.
A,B,C will be fearful deciding to not help, if they will not receive help themselves in the future.
This is the Shadow of the Future.

But a peer-to-peer system is much larger!

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Public history}

\pause
We need a public, tamper proof interaction history to incentivize collaboration and facilitate trust!
\end{frame}
\note{
You can have a whole network of participants connecting and providing help.
To still prevent freeriding the interactions have to be made public.
In such a network a participant can be malicious and we need to prevent his malicious behaviour.
We need a public, tamper proof interaction history to incentivize collaboration and facilitate trust!
So I now have described you the problem that MultiChain tries to solve.

\section{Design}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{MultiChain}
  \begin{figure}
        \includegraphics<1>[scale=0.3]{images/design/multichain-1.eps}
        \includegraphics<2>[scale=0.3]{images/design/multichain-2.eps}
        \includegraphics<3>[scale=0.3]{images/design/multichain-3.eps}
        \includegraphics<4->[scale=0.3]{images/design/multichain-4.eps}
        \caption{MultiChain blocks chained together and becoming entangled.}
	\end{figure}
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item<2-> The blocks are chained using pointers hash.
	    \item<3-> The chain of A and C are entangled.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\note{
I will now explain to you the design of MultiChain.
The basis of MultiChain are blocks.
A and B will create a block together.
This contains the data about the interaction between A and B.
I will later describe the contents of the blocks.

This block can be retrieved and inspected by anyone by contacting A or B.
Using this information he will be able to decide to help A.

If A and B were to interact again they will create a new block.
This block is chained to the previous block using a hash pointer.
A hash pointer can be described shortly as cryptographic value that describes the block it points to.
Both A and B have an individual pointer that points to the previous block.
This is because A and B both have a chain themselves,
and the previous block could be different blocks.

A now receives help from C,
and A and C now create a block together.
This block will be chained to the previous block of A.
Now the chain of A and C is entangled at the new block.

Also B could interact with another peer D.

\frametitle{Block creation protocol}
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics<1>[scale=0.3]{images/design/protocol-1.eps}
	\includegraphics<2>[scale=0.3]{images/design/protocol-2.eps}
	\includegraphics<3>[scale=0.3]{images/design/protocol-3.eps}

	\includegraphics<5>[scale=0.3]{images/design/protocol-5.eps}
	\caption{Sequence diagram for block creation.}
	\end{figure}
\end{frame}
\note{
If A is the uploader he will initiate the block creation protocol with B.
He wants his contribution to be commit to MultiChain.
So he creates a message and adds his data and signature on this message.

He will send this message containing requesting to B add his signature to the block.

B will append his data and his signature. THe block is now created.

B responds with a message containing the block and will immediately add this new block to his chain.

When the message arrives at A he will also add it to his chain.

The block is now present in both chains.

	        \item Signatures have the property of non-repudiation. Authors cannot revoke their authorship.
	    \end{itemize}
	}
\end{frame}
\note{
I will now describe to you the contents of a block.
First part is the up field.
This field contains the amount of data uploaded in MegaBytes by the uploader A.

The second part is the down field.
This contains the amount of data transferred back to A.

The public keys of A and B indentify A and B and are added to the block.

The total up and total down of A for the whole chain is added.

The hash pointer of A is added and a sequence number that identifies the block number in the chain of A.

This is all the added supplied by A.

Next, the total up and total down of B is added by B.

Also the hash pointer and sequence number of B is added.

The block contains the signature of A and B.
The signature of A is only on part of the block.
While B signs the whole block.

Because A and B signs the block they announce that it is truthfull and cannot later renounce that statement.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Half signed blocks}
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics<1>[scale=0.3]{images/design/halfsigned-chain-1.eps}
	\includegraphics<2>[scale=0.3]{images/design/halfsigned-chain-2.eps}
	\includegraphics<3>[scale=0.3]{images/design/halfsigned-chain-3.eps}

	\includegraphics<5->[scale=0.3]{images/design/halfsigned-chain-5.eps}
	\caption{A chain of with a half signed block in MultiChain.}
	\end{figure}

\end{frame}
\note{
But there is a problem in the protocol that arises from the fact that it is used in a asynchronous system.
There is no way of synchronizing with absolute certainty that both A and B commit their block to the chain.
So if A has given out a message that B can complete to create a blockm
he can always create this block at any moment he desires.

This causes the problem that A would have to wait indefinetly until B responds to create a new block.
If A would continue, then A would create a branch in his chain if B does create a block.
But B could fail or be malicious and deny A his response.

A major contribution of my thesis is the solution to this problem.
We introduce the notion of a half signed block.

So A and B have created a block like before.
A will wait on B until a certain period expires.
If B does not respond within this period, A will create a halfsigned block.
The part of B is missing.
After that A can continue interacting with for example C.

It is possible that B did create the block, but was to late to respond fast enough.
This block is added to the chain of B.
There is now an inconsitency of A and B.
But A gives proof that he tried to create a block and is not double spending.
The block is initiated by A and is therefore beneficial for him to exist,
so no abuse can happen.
So this inconsitency is acceptable.

B chains does continue using the full block.
A does not include the full block.
