\chapter{Known vulnerabilities}
\label{problems}
There are several known security vulnerabilities with the current design.
As said in section \ref{pb-aim} an incremental approach was taken.
As such, the design is part of a bigger system that as a whole is to be deployed in the real world.
In this section we will describe the known vulnerabilities
and explain the future work that is needed to solve these vulnerabilities.
