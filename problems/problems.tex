\chapter{Known vulnerabilities}
\label{problems}
There are several known security vulnerabilities with the current design.
As said in section \ref{pb-aim}, an incremental approach was taken.
As such, the design is part of a bigger system that as a whole is to be developed,
before it can be deployed in the real world.
The current implementation is not yet ready to fully replace BarterCast as a reputation system.
It is too vulnerable for malicious nodes to attack the system.
In this section we will describe the known vulnerabilities
and explain the future work that is needed to limit these vulnerabilities.
