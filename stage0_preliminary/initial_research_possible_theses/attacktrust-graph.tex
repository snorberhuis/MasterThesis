\section{Attack-resilient trust graph collection}

\subsection*{Problem summary}
Trust graphs typically rely on what others say about an identity.
But sources can be faked and all say that an identity is incredible.
This is a Sybil attack.
A system can be slow to react against these attacks.
This has been proven to stand in the way of protecting against sybil attack.

\subsection*{Directions of research}
A direction of research is to implement TrustGrowth.
The algorithm uses exclusion as a defense against sybil attacks.
Only reports are used if they can be linked back to the host node.
This for instances ignores unknown identities.

The first step is to implement and evaluate TrustGrowth.,

\subsection*{Threats}
This topic is proposed as a phd position at the PDS group.
So the threat is that the subject is too extensive to come up with something meaningful within a Master Thesis.

\subsection*{Related work}
The direction of research was done in a grant proposal by Dr. Ir. Pouwelse.
This proposal mentions several related work.
The previous generation of BarterCast is a trust graph, but it is vulnerable to whitewahsing, sybils and sinkhole attacks.
